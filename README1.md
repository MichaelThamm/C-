This is a quick explanation of the project

Why?

Its a fun way to learn C++ and machine learning (ML)
If this doesn't work try to reverse the process and have the NN try to predict what I am drawing based on user input
What you want to achieve is something that can still predict an ouput after training is done with unique input so what I can try to do is add noise to the array and see if the NN can still predict the keyboard input

What?

Based on user keystroke (keyboard or terminal entry)
- This includes any keyboard entry which will be input to the NN as a string which will use a dictionary to translate the keyboard entry to user defined array dimensions
