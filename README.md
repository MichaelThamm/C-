Purpose:

Using reinforcement learning, the NN will learn to predict the alphabet that you are drawing in the pixelated drawing board. This takes many generations to adequately train the model and was mainly intended as an intro project for NNs.

Requirements:

This could take 30 minutes for initial set up

-----------SCRATCH-----------

To create a workspace:
* [dev-env-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HD0pqVtsmw&t=0s)
* [dev-env-2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgCJbsCSARM&t=815s)

Setting up your own external libs:

Getting SDL2 to work:
* [setup-sdl2-with-VScode-mingw64-on-windows](https://giovanni.codes/setup-sdl2-with-visual-studio-code-and-mingw64-on-windows/)

More Linking Libs:
* [how-to-use-libraries](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10358745/how-to-use-libraries)
* [vscode-c-task-json-include-path-and-libraries](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52910102/vscode-c-task-json-include-path-and-libraries)

-----------HEAD-START-----------

Watch this video to install a compiler (mingw):
* [mingw-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
* [gcc-g++-gdb-windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HD0pqVtsmw&t=0s)

The #include main.h statement pulls all the class and function definitions from the [main.h header file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2cfz7klsQc). This cleans up the main.cpp code.

If you are having a hard time [use this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgCJbsCSARM&t=815s)

If it worked congrats!
* Expected result is some data dump to the terminal and a tab should open with a GUI of a red screen
* The C++ folder is large in size due to the external libs included (Eigen & SDL2)
  * If you want a barebones environment or do not need these, remove them from the terminal execution and the ./src folder
